&lt;uh&gt; up your's I don't want to work anymore whether I'm out there and you're screaming at me and they let me live luck was on my side again and I would entertain when we were not working every t- second Sunday we would not work and what happened in the morning we were very busy delousing everything the the the beds &lt;breath&gt; they were full of cockroaches and lice I mean we had lice by the tons I mean &lt;breath&gt; it's unbelievable how you get used to it even though we were shaved I mean under our arms on our hair the pubic ev- ev- ev- everywhere we have lice it just even if you &lt;breath&gt; if you go and and wash yourself if you if you were three hundred people if if if two hundred do not wash themselves you're gonna catch their lice and your cockroaches will be there &lt;breath&gt; so what we would do on Sundays we would just try to clean the beds though we had to keep our barracks spotless if you did not keep the barracks spotless you get punished when you come back from work &lt;breath&gt; but nonetheless the cockroaches were there &lt;breath&gt; and then when we had a little time I would enter- I would sing and that to me is my saving grace for many reasons first first of all when I sang I forgot where I was I got involved with the song I was singing and I think I made the other inmates kind of happy for that p- half hour that I was doing and on top of it the chef &lt;uh&gt; at the at the kitchen will give me a piece of bread and a soup extra &lt;breath&gt; I always say that you cannot survive alone in camps it's if you were alone you could not do it by yourself you had to have members of your family that you love and and stick together or you had to have friends &lt;breath&gt; &lt;uh&gt; my brother in law unfortunately and it's again my youth and I'm putting the blame on me for what I for whatever &lt;breath&gt; he said because he lost his two sons hold me like I am his son now and he was my brother in law only you know it is not somebody that I knew quite well &lt;breath&gt; and why should he tell me what to do &lt;breath&gt; and somehow we did not managed to get along quite well &lt;breath&gt; we were separated though though he stayed in the camps I saw him I saw him but we were not holding each other to dear life maybe if I maybe if I maybe if &lt;uh&gt; if it was my brother it would have been different I don't know &lt;breath&gt; but I got involved with two young French kids and they were magnificent @George and &lt;uh&gt; and &lt;uh&gt; &lt;uh&gt; &lt;breath&gt; can't even think of the other name but it will come to me anyway they they were we would stick together we would stick together we would share everything we had we would talk about our past and friends and &lt;uh&gt; &lt;breath&gt; and it was just marvelous and that helps you because if you feel low one day if the other person boost you up then th- your morale just go back up and that's what you needed I mean I have an example I have I have some friends called the @Fugels there were three brothers an- and a father in the second camp I was in and they were remarkable they just stuck together come rain or come shine and they survived the war and they went to Isreal the father died in Israel now and they still live in Israel &lt;breath&gt; but they were absolutely that nobody will nothing will ser- separate them they were very solid and it was great &lt;breath&gt; you see &lt;breath&gt; you see so many things when you when when human beings are equal because that's what we were in the camps except for the capos and then you &lt;unitelligible&gt; had a better way of living than we are but &lt;uh&gt; when human beings are equal then you you you see who is a good person who is not a good person s- and you see a lot of people who really show their true colors and it's very ugly I would think that most capos abused their power they were just they'd scream which was understandable when the Nazis were there when the SS were there because that's what the SS wanted to be kept in order to be to to to &lt;noise_begin&gt; run the camp properly &lt;noise_end&gt; otherwise they're gonna get their's but why do you scream when they're not there &lt;breath&gt; why do you still hit us when they're not there &lt;breath&gt; why show the other side show show that you're screaming because you have to scream because otherwise it's gonna be your ass but otherwise why do you scream &lt;breath&gt; why do you hit us &lt;breath&gt; and I've seen that too many times too many times by capos and I &lt;breath&gt; and it and it's a sad thing to say really anyway I stayed in that first camp nineteen months doing my four thousand pair of wooden heels a day &lt;breath&gt; and singing my head off and &lt;uh&gt; we for a very long time did not know about extermination camps at least when I saying we I should not say s- we I sh- say I did not know again my youth my innocence &lt;breath&gt; my not really wanting to realize where I was in even though I know where I was but I just didn't want to face the complete reality &lt;breath&gt; I did not know about the extermination camps every night even when I knew about extermination camp every night before I closed my eyes I would pray to God to save everybody in my family and I will just go from my father down to the last nephew say please save them like I am saved right now did not obey but I did that &lt;breath&gt; &lt;uh&gt; ev- as I said even when I knew the about extermination camp what they were doing with older people and younger children &lt;breath&gt; by that time I was but still in in I was hardened but still in my brain in some way I said maybe not maybe th- th- they escape like I'm escaping &lt;breath&gt; now nineteen months later we evacuate into @Achmud because it's going to be an &lt;uh&gt; &lt;uh&gt; English prisoner of war @stalag and we are we are sent all the hundred and fifty people to a to a satelight of Auschwitz called @Blackhammer and there it's a big camp because from &lt;uh&gt; from one hundred and fifty people we are three thousand in that camp &lt;breath&gt; brick walls which we did not have in @Achmud electrified barbed wire which we did not have in @Achmud guard towers which we did not have in @Achmud lots of barracks SS guarding us which we did not have in @Achmud they were all very (more) people a complete change and we arrived with we we are a hundred fifty people in this huge camp and [auer bach mach frie] the the the what they say in Auschwitz and they sent us to the yes
+&lt;spk2&gt; yes that's not being brave what I did it's really silly &lt;breath&gt; I mean luckily the foreman and this this Gestapo man liked me somehow they were not that that brutal they screamed somehow but they never you know hit us when I came back they never said anything to me I could have been killed he would have been the what's one more Jew who cares you know this guy this guy's saying &lt;uh&gt; &lt;uh&gt; up your's I don't want to work anymore whether I'm out there and you're screaming at me and they let me live luck was on my side again and I would entertain when we were not working every t- second Sunday we would not work and what happened in the morning we were very busy delousing everything the the the beds &lt;breath&gt; they were full of cockroaches and lice I mean we had lice by the tons I mean &lt;breath&gt; it's unbelievable how you get used to it even though we were shaved I mean under our arms on our hair the pubic ev- ev- ev- everywhere we have lice it just even if you &lt;breath&gt; if you go and and wash yourself if you if you were three hundred people if if if two hundred do not wash themselves you're gonna catch their lice and your cockroaches will be there &lt;breath&gt; so what we would do on Sundays we would just try to clean the beds though we had to keep our barracks spotless if you did not keep the barracks spotless you get punished when you come back from work &lt;breath&gt; but nonetheless the cockroaches were there &lt;breath&gt; and then when we had a little time I would enter- I would sing and that to me is my saving grace for many reasons first first of all when I sang I forgot where I was I got involved with the song I was singing and I think I made the other inmates kind of happy for that p- half hour that I was doing and on top of it the chef &lt;uh&gt; at the at the kitchen will give me a piece of bread and a soup extra &lt;breath&gt; I always say that you cannot survive alone in camps it's if you were alone you could not do it by yourself you had to have members of your family that you love and and stick together or you had to have friends &lt;breath&gt; &lt;uh&gt; my brother in law unfortunately and it's again my youth and I'm putting the blame on me for what I for whatever &lt;breath&gt; he said because he lost his two sons hold me like I am his son now and he was my brother in law only you know it is not somebody that I knew quite well &lt;breath&gt; and why should he tell me what to do &lt;breath&gt; and somehow we did not managed to get along quite well &lt;breath&gt; we were separated though though he stayed in the camps I saw him I saw him but we were not holding each other to dear life maybe if I maybe if I maybe if &lt;uh&gt; if it was my brother it would have been different I don't know &lt;breath&gt; but I got involved with two young French kids and they were magnificent @George and &lt;uh&gt; and &lt;uh&gt; &lt;uh&gt; &lt;breath&gt; can't even think of the other name but it will come to me anyway they they were we would stick together we would stick together we would share everything we had we would talk about our past and friends and &lt;uh&gt; &lt;breath&gt; and it was just marvelous and that helps you because if you feel low one day if the other person boost you up then th- your morale just go back up and that's what you needed I mean I have an example I have I have some friends called the @Fugels there were three brothers an- and a father in the second camp I was in and they were remarkable they just stuck together come rain or come shine and they survived the war and they went to Isreal the father died in Israel now and they still live in Israel &lt;breath&gt; but they were absolutely that nobody will nothing will ser- separate them they were very solid and it was great &lt;breath&gt; you see &lt;breath&gt; you see so many things when you when when human beings are equal because that's what we were in the camps except for the capos and then you &lt;unintelligible&gt; had a better way of living than we are but &lt;uh&gt; when human beings are equal then you you you see who is a good person who is not a good person s- and you see a lot of people who really show their true colors and it's very ugly I would think that most capos abused their power they were just they'd scream which was understandable when the Nazis were there when the SS were there because that's what the SS wanted to be kept in order to be to to to &lt;noise_begin&gt; run the camp properly &lt;noise_end&gt; otherwise they're gonna get their's but why do you scream when they're not there &lt;breath&gt; why do you still hit us when they're not there &lt;breath&gt; why show the other side show show that you're screaming because you have to scream because otherwise it's gonna be your ass but otherwise why do you scream &lt;breath&gt; why do you hit us &lt;breath&gt; and I've seen that too many times too many times by capos and I &lt;breath&gt; and it and it's a sad thing to say really anyway I stayed in that first camp nineteen months doing my four thousand pair of wooden heels a day &lt;breath&gt;
